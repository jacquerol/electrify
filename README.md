# electrify
Electrify is an early WIP retro electronics and robotics mod inspired by create, immersive engineering and opencomputers.

It aims to add a brand new type of customizable item and crafting system called gizmo, from which you wil be able to
build complex gadgets like flashlights, remote controls, lua smartphones and compact flight computers for your aeronautics needs.
Gizmos can be built on top of each other like matryoshka dolls using breadboards, integrated circuits, mass manufactured PCBs and 
all kinds of electronic components like diodes and transistors with simulated behaviors in a tinkercad fashion.

The mod is initially planned to (optionally) be a companion for create with colorful sparkly alternatives
to the mod's clockwork aesthetic while attempting to minimize bloat, focusing on gizmo implementation and then 
paving the way to modular robotic entities and cyberpunk/mechanicus like implants (possibly in an addon/sepparate mod).

Planned initial features:
- Wiring system with vanilla aesthetics: cables are 3d modeled and layed on the ground, they can pass through blocks and have outlets with plugs. 
- Make your own device: gizmos allow for powerful customization of your equipment with emerging complexity from electronic components with simplified behaviors.
- Smartify feature & premade gizmos: you can add custom behavior to blocks items and redstone with the programmable craftduinoâ„¢ board found in world loot.
- Create compat: generate electricity from stress units with alternators and move your contraptions with the programmable servo or brushless motor.
- Tiered progression: inspired by modpacks, complexity increasing integrated circuits (black boxes) will allow you for more powerful features/computation.
- Curios API integration: make wearable gizmos, allowing you to make wrist controllers, wireless earbuds or fancy lua programmable smart glasses.

Addon ideas:
- Chrome up: install prosthetic gizmos and customize yourself in many different ways or turn yourself into a full body prosthesis,
             heavily inspired by the cyberware mod, cyberpunk and mechanicus lore.
- Networld: access the overworld's wild internet dimension with vr gear to steal programs and obtain the ability to hack smart gizmos/implants.
- Nanotech: programmable matter, magic like gizmos and self building/reproducing/resurrecting robots.
